# bibot

Bibot is a cryptocurrency algorithmic trading software developed in python (3.7+) and supported on Linux.

## Features

-Backtested trading: Run your strategy backed by downloaded historical data.

-Optimized: Works with optimized parameters which employs machine learning methods.

-Run: Test your strategy with simulated money (Demo mode) or deploy it with real money (Live mode). The concept is to find the best historical trade expectancy by markets based on variation of the stop-loss and then allow/reject markets to trade. The sizing of the trade is based on a risk of a percentage of your capital.
